## **What I have done in this assignment** <br>
In this project, I have implemented a system to deal with resource allocation based on client queries for COVID-19. <br>

**Phase 1 Boot up the hospitals and scheduler** <br>
  - Scheduler set up the UDP socket and wait for the boot-up message from hospitals. 
  - Hospital A, B and C read the map.txt and construct the location graph. 
  - Construct a data structure to store the capacity and occupancy of hospitals for book-keep the availability of hospitals.

**Phase 2 Forward stage**<br>
  - The client send the query to the scheduler server.
  - The Scheduler server receive the query and decide the hospitals that still have availablity.<br>
**Phase 3 Scoring**<br>
  -
